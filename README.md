# &lt;Ivy League> Courses
## So what is &lt;Ivy League> Courses
&lt;Ivy League> Courses is a website and a searchable portal with access to 400+ free online courses from the big Ivy League Schools. This is based on a post made by Quartz on [400 free Ivy League university courses](https://qz.com/1514408/400-free-ivy-league-university-courses-you-can-take-online-in-2019/). I figured that it'd be beneficial to place them all into one searchable location. 

## Current status of the project
I don't currently plan to continue fixing the website or the courses until I gain some more free time and/or more help.

## So how can I help?
The biggest help right now is with keeping the links and courses up-to-date. You can suggest edits at [this Google Sheets document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fC1YxG_7sApx5IiF0wl8FrgjZbPdaRQhiCZppG9vXtY/edit?usp=sharing).

If you plan to help with fixing any code or such, note that I used [TableTop.js]([https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop)) to read the data from the Google Sheets document. Something that should be investigated is other ways of hosting the "dynamic" data and then relaying it to a static host such as Github pages.

If you're willing to help with code, I do want to extend this project further and create a true searchable system full of free valuable courses of all different kinds. Feel free to contact me if you wish to help contribute to the current project or the larger project.
